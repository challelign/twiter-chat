Hi Emily,

I hope youâ€™re well! Iâ€™m currently pursuing software developer roles and wanted to ask for your support. As a full-stack developer skilled in MERN (MongoDB,MYSQL, Express, React, Node.js), Next.js, and TypeScript, I excel at building end-to-end solutions. Would you be open to sharing advice, referrals, or opportunities that could help me land a role?

Thanks so much for your time and guidance!

Best,
